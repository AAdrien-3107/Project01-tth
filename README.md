This is my first project using Javascript for my the tech degree path.
In this project you will be able to click on a button that will generate quotes randomly.

Together with the quotes you will find the author and the source but also if available the tag, the year or the citation.

I hope you enjoy and if you have any input please feel free to let me know.

Happy coding everyone.
